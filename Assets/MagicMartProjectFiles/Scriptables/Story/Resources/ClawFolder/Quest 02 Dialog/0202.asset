  - Why exactly do you need this?
  - "Mr. Wiggles\u2026 He\u2019s not himself anymore."
  - What happened??
  - "The salad you made last time. I think it was too strong for him. He\u2019s just
    a little baby you know\u2026"
  - "Wiggles has so much energy now, that he can't stop running and do cartwheels.\r
    I\u2019m worried that he\u2019ll hurt himself!\r"
  - 'Oh god! This could be one of the side effects of the salad. The Moonlight Dumplings
    are a good antidote and shall calm your hamster down.

  - Many thanks, little guy. I will try this right away.
