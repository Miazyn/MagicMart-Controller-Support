  - "Well anyways, my name\u2019s Claw, Destroyer of Mankind.\r"
  - 'I actually came here because my baby Mr. Wiggles has an ouchie.

    squeak!'
  - "Aww he\u2019s wearing a coat! Is he cold?"
  - "Oh no.. I\u2019ve recently discovered my passion for knitting and sewing, so
    I make cute outfits for my hamster in my free time.\r\n"
  - "That's lovely, Mr. Wiggles seems to like it.\r What exactly seems to be the
    problem with your hamster?\r"
  - "Sooo\u2026 Mr. Wiggles sometimes gets the zoomies and gets fast and furious
    on his hamster wheel."
  - O-Oh?
  - 'But today he managed to launch himself out of the wheel and slam into the wall.
    The vet I went to was useless so I hope that the fruit salad will heal his ouchie.


'
  - "I can't thank you enough, inferior being! \r"
  - 'M-mhm yeah no problem. Get well soon!

'
  - Well then, see you around!
