  - "It\u2019s embarrassing to say this and if you tell anyone about this it will
    not. end. well. for you"
  - "But.\r I accidentally used the poison from last time as a perfume. \r\n"
  - 'What?? How? You were aware that it''s poison!!

    boyfriend away from me.\r\n"
  - "I, wow. That took a turn.\r I shouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear this from
    you.\r\n"
  - 'Well, just so you know, you will not get any kind of deadly poison from me ever
    again.

  - "Too bad but she\u2019s dead now anyway. Have a nice day"
